# anti-road-flooding
An innovative automation built to solve an actual flooding problem in my school.

## The Problem
Outside my school's road, every time it rains, the road gets flooded. Many cars and pedestrians get trapped there. We wanted to do something about it.

## The Solution
We created a model of a possible solution that could be implemented, where the water level would be detected, and the road would be closed in case of a flood, therefore protecting the pedestrians/cars from accidents. The water collected from the pump would then be used for other environmental purposes.
